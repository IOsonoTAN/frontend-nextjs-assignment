We plan to launch a CRUD system for use in our back office, so we need your help to create the system from Next.js with React.js and Typescript, and the structure is flexible, easy to understand, and easy to be supported by your team members.

And here are the requirements of the CRUD system, and we focus on creating a user controller first.
1. We need a list of users, which you can get from our API.
2. We need a dialog popup to show the user detailed data from a row.
3. We need a create user form and send it to our API. But, we must validate fields before submitting and show any error as an alert message.
4. We need confirmation after submission, such as a toast or an alert message in the popup, and to refresh the data from the API.
5. The design is unnecessary, you can design whatever you like, but the function must work well, and we prefer to use MUI, AntDesign, or Tailwind to reduce your time.
